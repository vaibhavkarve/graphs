    The first part of the symbol name is considered to be its actual
    'name', followed by super- and subscripts. Each superscript is
    preceded with a "^" character or by "__". Each subscript is preceded
    by a "_" character.  The three return values are the actual name, a
    list with superscripts and a list with subscripts.
