"""Prettyprinter by Jurjen Bos.
(I hate spammers: mail me at pietjepuk314 at the reverse of ku.oc.oohay).
All objects have a method that create a "stringPict",
that can be used in the str method for pretty printing.

Updates by Jason Gedge (email <my last name> at cs mun ca)
    - terminal_string() method
    - minor fixes and changes (mostly to prettyForm)

    - Allow left/center/right alignment options for above/below and
      top/center/bottom alignment options for left/right
