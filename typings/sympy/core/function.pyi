There are three types of functions implemented in SymPy:

    1) defined functions (in the sense that they can be evaluated) like
       exp or sin; they have a name and a body:
           f = exp
    2) undefined function which have a name but no body. Undefined
       functions can be defined using a Function class as follows:
           f = Function('f')
       (the result will be a Function instance)
    3) anonymous function (or lambda function) which have a body (defined
       with dummy variables) but have no name:
           f = Lambda(x, exp(x)*x)
           f = Lambda((x, y), exp(x)*y)
    The fourth type of functions are composites, like (sin + cos)(x); these work in
    SymPy core, but are not yet part of SymPy.

class Function(Application, Expr):

    Base class for applied mathematical functions.

    It also serves as a constructor for undefined function classes.

    See the :ref:`custom-functions` guide for details on how to subclass
    ``Function`` and what methods can be defined.

    Examples
    ========

    **Undefined Functions**

    To create an undefined function, pass a string of the function name to
    ``Function``.

    >>> from sympy import Function, Symbol
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> f = Function('f')
    >>> g = Function('g')(x)
    >>> f
    f
    >>> f(x)
    f(x)
    >>> g
    g(x)
    >>> f(x).diff(x)
    Derivative(f(x), x)
    >>> g.diff(x)
    Derivative(g(x), x)

    Assumptions can be passed to ``Function`` the same as with a
    :class:`~.Symbol`. Alternatively, you can use a ``Symbol`` with
    assumptions for the function name and the function will inherit the name
    and assumptions associated with the ``Symbol``:

    >>> f_real = Function('f', real=True)
    >>> f_real(x).is_real
    True
    >>> f_real_inherit = Function(Symbol('f', real=True))
    >>> f_real_inherit(x).is_real
    True

    Note that assumptions on a function are unrelated to the assumptions on
    the variables it is called on. If you want to add a relationship, subclass
    ``Function`` and define custom assumptions handler methods. See the
    :ref:`custom-functions-assumptions` section of the :ref:`custom-functions`
    guide for more details.

    **Custom Function Subclasses**

    The :ref:`custom-functions` guide has several
    :ref:`custom-functions-complete-examples` of how to subclass ``Function``
    to create a custom function.

    Denesting of derivatives retains the ordering of variables:

        >>> Derivative(Derivative(f(x, y), y), x)
        Derivative(f(x, y), y, x)

    Contiguously identical symbols are merged into a tuple giving
    the symbol and the count:

        >>> Derivative(f(x), x, x, y, x)
        Derivative(f(x), (x, 2), y, x)

    order of the variables of differentiation will be made canonical:

        >>> Derivative(f(x, y), y, x, evaluate=True)
        Derivative(f(x, y), x, y)

    Derivatives with respect to undefined functions can be calculated:

        >>> Derivative(f(x)**2, f(x), evaluate=True)
        2*f(x)

    Such derivatives will show up when the chain rule is used to
    evaluate a derivative:

        >>> f(g(x)).diff(x)
        Derivative(f(g(x)), g(x))*Derivative(g(x), x)

    Substitution is used to represent derivatives of functions with

        >>> f(2*x + 3).diff(x) == 2*Subs(f(y).diff(y), y, 2*x + 3)
        True

    Notes
    =====

    Simplification of high-order derivatives:

    Because there can be a significant amount of simplification that can be
    done when multiple differentiations are performed, results will be
    automatically simplified in a fairly conservative fashion unless the
    keyword ``simplify`` is set to False.

        >>> from sympy import sqrt, diff, Function, symbols
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
        >>> f, g = symbols('f,g', cls=Function)

        >>> e = sqrt((x + 1)**2 + x)
        >>> diff(e, (x, 5), simplify=False).count_ops()
        136
        >>> diff(e, (x, 5)).count_ops()
        30

    Ordering of variables:

    If evaluate is set to True and the expression cannot be evaluated, the
    list of differentiation symbols will be sorted, that is, the expression is
    assumed to have continuous derivatives up to the order asked.

    Derivative wrt non-Symbols:

    For the most part, one may not differentiate wrt non-symbols.
    For example, we do not allow differentiation wrt `x*y` because
    there are multiple ways of structurally defining where x*y appears
    in an expression: a very strict definition would make
    (x*y*z).diff(x*y) == 0. Derivatives wrt defined functions (like
    cos(x)) are not allowed, either:

        >>> (x*y*z).diff(x*y)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: Can't calculate derivative wrt x*y.

    To make it easier to work with variational calculus, however,
    derivatives wrt AppliedUndef and Derivatives are allowed.
    For example, in the Euler-Lagrange method one may write
    F(t, u, v) where u = f(t) and v = f'(t). These variables can be
    written explicitly as functions of time::

        >>> from sympy.abc import t
        >>> F = Function('F')
        >>> U = f(t)
        >>> V = U.diff(t)

    The derivative wrt f(t) can be obtained directly:

        >>> direct = F(t, U, V).diff(U)

    When differentiation wrt a non-Symbol is attempted, the non-Symbol
    is temporarily converted to a Symbol while the differentiation
    is performed and the same answer is obtained:

        >>> indirect = F(t, U, V).subs(U, x).diff(x).subs(x, U)
        >>> assert direct == indirect

    The implication of this non-symbol replacement is that all
    functions are treated as independent of other functions and the
    symbols are independent of the functions that contain them::

        >>> x.diff(f(x))
        0
        >>> g(x).diff(f(x))
        0

    It also means that derivatives are assumed to depend only
    on the variables of differentiation, not on anything contained
    within the expression being differentiated::

        >>> F = f(x)
        >>> Fx = F.diff(x)
        >>> Fx.diff(F)  # derivative depends on x, not F
        0
        >>> Fxx = Fx.diff(x)
        >>> Fxx.diff(Fx)  # derivative depends on x, not Fx
        0

    The last example can be made explicit by showing the replacement
    of Fx in Fxx with y:

        >>> Fxx.subs(Fx, y)
        Derivative(y, x)

        Since that in itself will evaluate to zero, differentiating
        wrt Fx will also be zero:

        >>> _.doit()
        0

    Replacing undefined functions with concrete expressions

    One must be careful to replace undefined functions with expressions
    that contain variables consistent with the function definition and
    the variables of differentiation or else insconsistent result will
    be obtained. Consider the following example:

    >>> eq = f(x)*g(y)
    >>> eq.subs(f(x), x*y).diff(x, y).doit()
    y*Derivative(g(y), y) + g(y)
    >>> eq.diff(x, y).subs(f(x), x*y).doit()
    y*Derivative(g(y), y)

    The results differ because `f(x)` was replaced with an expression
    that involved both variables of differentiation. In the abstract
    case, differentiation of `f(x)` by `y` is 0; in the concrete case,
    the presence of `y` made that derivative nonvanishing and produced
    the extra `g(y)` term.

    Defining differentiation for an object

    An object must define ._eval_derivative(symbol) method that returns
    the differentiation result. This function only needs to consider the
    non-trivial case where expr contains symbol and it should call the diff()
    method internally (not _eval_derivative); Derivative should be the only
    one to call _eval_derivative.

    Any class can allow derivatives to be taken with respect to
    itself (while indicating its scalar nature). See the
    docstring of Expr._diff_wrt.

        Parameters
        ==========

        points : sequence or coefficient, optional
            If sequence: discrete values (length >= order+1) of the
            independent variable used for generating the finite
            difference weights.
            If it is a coefficient, it will be used as the step-size
            for generating an equidistant sequence of length order+1
            centered around ``x0``. Default: 1 (step-size 1)

        x0 : number or Symbol, optional
            the value of the independent variable (``wrt``) at which the
            derivative is to be approximated. Default: same as ``wrt``.

        wrt : Symbol, optional
            "with respect to" the variable for which the (partial)
            derivative is to be approximated for. If not provided it
            is required that the derivative is ordinary. Default: ``None``.


        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import symbols, Function, exp, sqrt, Symbol
        >>> x, h = symbols('x h')
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> f(x).diff(x).as_finite_difference()
        -f(x - 1/2) + f(x + 1/2)

        The default step size and number of points are 1 and
        ``order + 1`` respectively. We can change the step size by
        passing a symbol as a parameter:

        >>> f(x).diff(x).as_finite_difference(h)
        -f(-h/2 + x)/h + f(h/2 + x)/h

        We can also specify the discretized values to be used in a
        sequence:

        >>> f(x).diff(x).as_finite_difference([x, x+h, x+2*h])
        -3*f(x)/(2*h) + 2*f(h + x)/h - f(2*h + x)/(2*h)

        The algorithm is not restricted to use equidistant spacing, nor
        do we need to make the approximation around ``x0``, but we can get
        an expression estimating the derivative at an offset:

        >>> e, sq2 = exp(1), sqrt(2)
        >>> xl = [x-h, x+h, x+e*h]
        >>> f(x).diff(x, 1).as_finite_difference(xl, x+h*sq2)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        2*h*((h + sqrt(2)*h)/(2*h) - (-sqrt(2)*h + h)/(2*h))*f(E*h + x)/...

        To approximate ``Derivative`` around ``x0`` using a non-equidistant
        spacing step, the algorithm supports assignment of undefined
        functions to ``points``:

        >>> dx = Function('dx')
        >>> f(x).diff(x).as_finite_difference(points=dx(x), x0=x-h)
        -f(-h + x - dx(-h + x)/2)/dx(-h + x) + f(-h + x + dx(-h + x)/2)/dx(-h + x)

        Partial derivatives are also supported:

        >>> y = Symbol('y')
        >>> d2fdxdy=f(x,y).diff(x,y)
        >>> d2fdxdy.as_finite_difference(wrt=x)
        -Derivative(f(x - 1/2, y), y) + Derivative(f(x + 1/2, y), y)

        We can apply ``as_finite_difference`` to ``Derivative`` instances in
        compound expressions using ``replace``:

        >>> (1 + 42**f(x).diff(x)).replace(lambda arg: arg.is_Derivative,
        ...     lambda arg: arg.as_finite_difference())
        42**(-f(x - 1/2) + f(x + 1/2)) + 1

class Subs(Expr):
    """
    Represents unevaluated substitutions of an expression.

    ``Subs(expr, x, x0)`` represents the expression resulting
    from substituting x with x0 in expr.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Expr
        An expression.

    x : tuple, variable
        A variable or list of distinct variables.

    x0 : tuple or list of tuples
        A point or list of evaluation points
        corresponding to those variables.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Subs, Function, sin, cos
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> f = Function('f')

    Subs are created when a particular substitution cannot be made. The
    x in the derivative cannot be replaced with 0 because 0 is not a
    valid variables of differentiation:

    >>> f(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0)
    Subs(Derivative(f(x), x), x, 0)

    Once f is known, the derivative and evaluation at 0 can be done:

    >>> _.subs(f, sin).doit() == sin(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0) == cos(0)
    True

    Subs can also be created directly with one or more variables:

    >>> Subs(f(x)*sin(y) + z, (x, y), (0, 1))
    Subs(z + f(x)*sin(y), (x, y), (0, 1))
    >>> _.doit()
    z + f(0)*sin(1)

    Notes
    =====

    ``Subs`` objects are generally useful to represent unevaluated derivatives
    calculated at a point.

    The variables may be expressions, but they are subjected to the limitations
    of subs(), so it is usually a good practice to use only symbols for
    variables, since in that case there can be no ambiguity.

    There's no automatic expansion - use the method .doit() to effect all
    possible substitutions of the object and also of objects inside the
    expression.

    When evaluating derivatives at a point that is not a symbol, a Subs object
    is returned. One is also able to calculate derivatives of Subs objects - in
    this case the expression is always expanded (for the unevaluated form, use
    Derivative()).

    In order to allow expressions to combine before doit is done, a
    representation of the Subs expression is used internally to make
    expressions that are superficially different compare the same:

    >>> a, b = Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0)
    >>> a + b
    2*Subs(x, x, 0)

    This can lead to unexpected consequences when using methods
    like `has` that are cached:

    >>> s = Subs(x, x, 0)
    >>> s.has(x), s.has(y)
    (True, False)
    >>> ss = s.subs(x, y)
    >>> ss.has(x), ss.has(y)
    (True, False)
    >>> s, ss
    (Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0))

def diff(f, *symbols, **kwargs): # -> ArrayDerivative | Derivative:

    Differentiate f with respect to symbols.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is just a wrapper to unify .diff() and the Derivative class; its
    interface is similar to that of integrate().  You can use the same
    shortcuts for multiple variables as with Derivative.  For example,
    diff(f(x), x, x, x) and diff(f(x), x, 3) both return the third derivative
    of f(x).

    You can pass evaluate=False to get an unevaluated Derivative class.  Note
    that if there are 0 symbols (such as diff(f(x), x, 0), then the result will
    be the function (the zeroth derivative), even if evaluate=False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sin, cos, Function, diff
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> f = Function('f')

    >>> diff(sin(x), x)

    >>> diff(f(x), x, x, x)
    Derivative(f(x), (x, 3))
    >>> diff(f(x), x, 3)
    Derivative(f(x), (x, 3))
    >>> diff(sin(x)*cos(y), x, 2, y, 2)

    >>> type(diff(sin(x), x, 0, evaluate=False))

    cos(x)
    >>> diff(sin(x*y))
    Traceback (most recent call last):

def expand(e, deep=..., modulus=..., power_base=..., power_exp=..., mul=..., log=..., multinomial=..., basic=..., **hints):
    r"""
    Expand an expression using methods given as hints.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Hints evaluated unless explicitly set to False are:  ``basic``, ``log``,
    ``multinomial``, ``mul``, ``power_base``, and ``power_exp`` The following
    hints are supported but not applied unless set to True:  ``complex``,
    ``func``, and ``trig``.  In addition, the following meta-hints are
    supported by some or all of the other hints:  ``frac``, ``numer``,
    ``denom``, ``modulus``, and ``force``.  ``deep`` is supported by all
    hints.  Additionally, subclasses of Expr may define their own hints or
    meta-hints.

    The ``basic`` hint is used for any special rewriting of an object that
    should be done automatically (along with the other hints like ``mul``)
    when expand is called. This is a catch-all hint to handle any sort of
    expansion that may not be described by the existing hint names. To use
    this hint an object should override the ``_eval_expand_basic`` method.
    Objects may also define their own expand methods, which are not run by
    default.  See the API section below.

    If ``deep`` is set to ``True`` (the default), things like arguments of
    functions are recursively expanded.  Use ``deep=False`` to only expand on
    the top level.

    If the ``force`` hint is used, assumptions about variables will be ignored
    in making the expansion.

    Hints
    =====

    These hints are run by default

    mul
    ---

    Distributes multiplication over addition:

    >>> from sympy import cos, exp, sin
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> (y*(x + z)).expand(mul=True)
    x*y + y*z

    multinomial
    -----------

    Expand (x + y + ...)**n where n is a positive integer.

    >>> ((x + y + z)**2).expand(multinomial=True)
    x**2 + 2*x*y + 2*x*z + y**2 + 2*y*z + z**2

    power_exp
    ---------

    Expand addition in exponents into multiplied bases.

    >>> exp(x + y).expand(power_exp=True)
    exp(x)*exp(y)
    >>> (2**(x + y)).expand(power_exp=True)
    2**x*2**y

    power_base
    ----------

    Split powers of multiplied bases.

    This only happens by default if assumptions allow, or if the
    ``force`` meta-hint is used:

    >>> ((x*y)**z).expand(power_base=True)
    (x*y)**z
    >>> ((x*y)**z).expand(power_base=True, force=True)
    x**z*y**z
    >>> ((2*y)**z).expand(power_base=True)
    2**z*y**z

    Note that in some cases where this expansion always holds, SymPy performs
    it automatically:

    >>> (x*y)**2
    x**2*y**2

    log
    ---

    Pull out power of an argument as a coefficient and split logs products
    into sums of logs.

    Note that these only work if the arguments of the log function have the
    proper assumptions--the arguments must be positive and the exponents must
    be real--or else the ``force`` hint must be True:

    >>> from sympy import log, symbols
    >>> log(x**2*y).expand(log=True)
    log(x**2*y)
    >>> log(x**2*y).expand(log=True, force=True)
    2*log(x) + log(y)
    >>> x, y = symbols('x,y', positive=True)
    >>> log(x**2*y).expand(log=True)
    2*log(x) + log(y)

    basic
    -----

    This hint is intended primarily as a way for custom subclasses to enable
    expansion by default.

    These hints are not run by default:

    complex
    -------

    Split an expression into real and imaginary parts.

    >>> x, y = symbols('x,y')
    >>> (x + y).expand(complex=True)
    re(x) + re(y) + I*im(x) + I*im(y)
    >>> cos(x).expand(complex=True)
    -I*sin(re(x))*sinh(im(x)) + cos(re(x))*cosh(im(x))

    Note that this is just a wrapper around ``as_real_imag()``.  Most objects
    that wish to redefine ``_eval_expand_complex()`` should consider
    redefining ``as_real_imag()`` instead.

    func
    ----

    Expand other functions.

    >>> from sympy import gamma
    >>> gamma(x + 1).expand(func=True)
    x*gamma(x)

    trig
    ----

    Do trigonometric expansions.

    >>> cos(x + y).expand(trig=True)
    -sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y)
    >>> sin(2*x).expand(trig=True)
    2*sin(x)*cos(x)

    Note that the forms of ``sin(n*x)`` and ``cos(n*x)`` in terms of ``sin(x)``
    and ``cos(x)`` are not unique, due to the identity `\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)
    = 1`.  The current implementation uses the form obtained from Chebyshev
    polynomials, but this may change.  See `this MathWorld article
    <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Multiple-AngleFormulas.html>`_ for more
    information.

    Notes
    =====

    - You can shut off unwanted methods::

        >>> (exp(x + y)*(x + y)).expand()
        x*exp(x)*exp(y) + y*exp(x)*exp(y)
        >>> (exp(x + y)*(x + y)).expand(power_exp=False)
        x*exp(x + y) + y*exp(x + y)
        >>> (exp(x + y)*(x + y)).expand(mul=False)
        (x + y)*exp(x)*exp(y)

    - Use deep=False to only expand on the top level::

        >>> exp(x + exp(x + y)).expand()
        exp(x)*exp(exp(x)*exp(y))
        >>> exp(x + exp(x + y)).expand(deep=False)
        exp(x)*exp(exp(x + y))

    - Hints are applied in an arbitrary, but consistent order (in the current
      implementation, they are applied in alphabetical order, except
      multinomial comes before mul, but this may change).  Because of this,
      some hints may prevent expansion by other hints if they are applied
      first. For example, ``mul`` may distribute multiplications and prevent
      ``log`` and ``power_base`` from expanding them. Also, if ``mul`` is
      applied before ``multinomial`, the expression might not be fully
      distributed. The solution is to use the various ``expand_hint`` helper
      functions or to use ``hint=False`` to this function to finely control
      which hints are applied. Here are some examples::

        >>> from sympy import expand, expand_mul, expand_power_base
        >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', positive=True)

        >>> expand(log(x*(y + z)))
        log(x) + log(y + z)

      Here, we see that ``log`` was applied before ``mul``.  To get the mul
      expanded form, either of the following will work::

        >>> expand_mul(log(x*(y + z)))
        log(x*y + x*z)
        >>> expand(log(x*(y + z)), log=False)
        log(x*y + x*z)

      A similar thing can happen with the ``power_base`` hint::

        >>> expand((x*(y + z))**x)
        (x*y + x*z)**x

      To get the ``power_base`` expanded form, either of the following will
      work::

        >>> expand((x*(y + z))**x, mul=False)
        x**x*(y + z)**x
        >>> expand_power_base((x*(y + z))**x)
        x**x*(y + z)**x

        >>> expand((x + y)*y/x)
        y + y**2/x

      The parts of a rational expression can be targeted::

        >>> expand((x + y)*y/x/(x + 1), frac=True)
        (x*y + y**2)/(x**2 + x)
        >>> expand((x + y)*y/x/(x + 1), numer=True)
        (x*y + y**2)/(x*(x + 1))
        >>> expand((x + y)*y/x/(x + 1), denom=True)
        y*(x + y)/(x**2 + x)

    - The ``modulus`` meta-hint can be used to reduce the coefficients of an
      expression post-expansion::

        >>> expand((3*x + 1)**2)
        9*x**2 + 6*x + 1
        >>> expand((3*x + 1)**2, modulus=5)
        4*x**2 + x + 1

    - Either ``expand()`` the function or ``.expand()`` the method can be
      used.  Both are equivalent::

        >>> expand((x + 1)**2)
        x**2 + 2*x + 1
        >>> ((x + 1)**2).expand()
        x**2 + 2*x + 1

    API
    ===

    Objects can define their own expand hints by defining
    ``_eval_expand_hint()``.  The function should take the form::

        def _eval_expand_hint(self, **hints):
            # Only apply the method to the top-level expression
            ...

    See also the example below.  Objects should define ``_eval_expand_hint()``
    methods only if ``hint`` applies to that specific object.  The generic
    ``_eval_expand_hint()`` method defined in Expr will handle the no-op case.

    Each hint should be responsible for expanding that hint only.
    Furthermore, the expansion should be applied to the top-level expression
    only.  ``expand()`` takes care of the recursion that happens when
    ``deep=True``.

    You should only call ``_eval_expand_hint()`` methods directly if you are
    100% sure that the object has the method, as otherwise you are liable to
    get unexpected ``AttributeError``s.  Note, again, that you do not need to
    recursively apply the hint to args of your object: this is handled
    automatically by ``expand()``.  ``_eval_expand_hint()`` should
    generally not be used at all outside of an ``_eval_expand_hint()`` method.
    If you want to apply a specific expansion from within another method, use
    the public ``expand()`` function, method, or ``expand_hint()`` functions.

    In order for expand to work, objects must be rebuildable by their args,
    i.e., ``obj.func(*obj.args) == obj`` must hold.

    Expand methods are passed ``**hints`` so that expand hints may use
    'metahints'--hints that control how different expand methods are applied.
    For example, the ``force=True`` hint described above that causes
    ``expand(log=True)`` to ignore assumptions is such a metahint.  The
    ``deep`` meta-hint is handled exclusively by ``expand()`` and is not
    passed to ``_eval_expand_hint()`` methods.

    Note that expansion hints should generally be methods that perform some
    kind of 'expansion'.  For hints that simply rewrite an expression, use the
    .rewrite() API.

def expand_power_base(expr, deep=..., force=...):
    """
    Wrapper around expand that only uses the power_base hint.

    A wrapper to expand(power_base=True) which separates a power with a base
    that is a Mul into a product of powers, without performing any other
    expansions, provided that assumptions about the power's base and exponent
    allow.

    deep=False (default is True) will only apply to the top-level expression.

    force=True (default is False) will cause the expansion to ignore
    assumptions about the base and exponent. When False, the expansion will
    only happen if the base is non-negative or the exponent is an integer.

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> from sympy import expand_power_base, sin, cos, exp, Symbol

    >>> (x*y)**2
    x**2*y**2

    >>> (2*x)**y
    (2*x)**y
    >>> expand_power_base(_)
    2**y*x**y

    >>> expand_power_base((x*y)**z)
    (x*y)**z
    >>> expand_power_base((x*y)**z, force=True)

    >>> expand_power_base(sin((x*y)**z), deep=False)
    sin((x*y)**z)
    >>> expand_power_base(sin((x*y)**z), force=True)
    sin(x**z*y**z)

    >>> expand_power_base((2*sin(x))**y + (2*cos(x))**y)
    2**y*sin(x)**y + 2**y*cos(x)**y

    >>> expand_power_base((2*exp(y))**x)
    2**x*exp(y)**x

    >>> expand_power_base((2*cos(x))**y)
    2**y*cos(x)**y

    Notice that sums are left untouched. If this is not the desired behavior,
    apply full ``expand()`` to the expression:

    >>> expand_power_base(((x+y)*z)**2)
    z**2*(x + y)**2
    >>> (((x+y)*z)**2).expand()
    x**2*z**2 + 2*x*y*z**2 + y**2*z**2

    >>> expand_power_base((2*y)**(1+z))
    2**(z + 1)*y**(z + 1)
    >>> ((2*y)**(1+z)).expand()
    2*2**z*y**(z + 1)

    The power that is unexpanded can be expanded safely when
    ``y != 0``, otherwise different values might be obtained for the expression:

    >>> prev = _

    If we indicate that ``y`` is positive but then replace it with
    a value of 0 after expansion, the expression becomes 0:

    >>> p = Symbol('p', positive=True)
    >>> prev.subs(y, p).expand().subs(p, 0)
    0

    But if ``z = -1`` the expression would not be zero:

    >>> prev.subs(y, 0).subs(z, -1)
    1

def count_ops(expr, visual=...):
    """
    Return a representation (integer or expression) of the operations in expr.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Expr
        If expr is an iterable, the sum of the op counts of the
        items will be returned.

    visual : bool, optional
        If ``False`` (default) then the sum of the coefficients of the
        visual expression will be returned.
        If ``True`` then the number of each type of operation is shown
        with the core class types (or their virtual equivalent) multiplied by the
        number of times they occur.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, x, y
    >>> from sympy import sin, count_ops

    Although there is not a SUB object, minus signs are interpreted as
    either negations or subtractions:

    >>> (x - y).count_ops(visual=True)
    SUB
    >>> (-x).count_ops(visual=True)
    NEG

    Here, there are two Adds and a Pow:

    >>> (1 + a + b**2).count_ops(visual=True)
    2*ADD + POW

    In the following, an Add, Mul, Pow and two functions:

    >>> (sin(x)*x + sin(x)**2).count_ops(visual=True)
    ADD + MUL + POW + 2*SIN

    for a total of 5:

    >>> (sin(x)*x + sin(x)**2).count_ops(visual=False)
    5

    Note that "what you type" is not always what you get. The expression
    1/x/y is translated by sympy into 1/(x*y) so it gives a DIV and MUL rather
    than two DIVs:

    >>> (1/x/y).count_ops(visual=True)
    DIV + MUL

    The visual option can be used to demonstrate the difference in
    operations for expressions in different forms. Here, the Horner
    representation is compared with the expanded form of a polynomial:

    >>> eq=x*(1 + x*(2 + x*(3 + x)))
    >>> count_ops(eq.expand(), visual=True) - count_ops(eq, visual=True)
    -MUL + 3*POW

    The count_ops function also handles iterables:

    >>> count_ops([x, sin(x), None, True, x + 2], visual=False)
    2
    >>> count_ops([x, sin(x), None, True, x + 2], visual=True)
    ADD + SIN
    >>> count_ops({x: sin(x), x + 2: y + 1}, visual=True)
    2*ADD + SIN
