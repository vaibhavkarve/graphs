"""
Module to efficiently partition SymPy objects.

This system is introduced because class of SymPy object does not always
represent the mathematical classification of the entity. For example,
``Integral(1, x)`` and ``Integral(Matrix([1,2]), x)`` are both instance
of ``Integral`` class. However the former is number and the latter is
matrix.

One way to resolve this is defining subclass for each mathematical type,
such as ``MatAdd`` for the addition between matrices. Basic algebraic
operation such as addition or multiplication take this approach, but
defining every class for every mathematical object is not scalable.

Therefore, we define the "kind" of the object and let the expression
infer the kind of itself from its arguments. Function and class can
filter the arguments by their kind, and behave differently according to
the type of itself.

This module defines basic kinds for core objects. Other kinds such as
``ArrayKind`` or ``MatrixKind`` can be found in corresponding modules.

.. notes::
       This approach is experimental, and can be replaced or deleted in the future.

    Base class for kinds.

    Kind of the object represents the mathematical classification that
    the entity falls into. It is expected that functions and classes
    recognize and filter the argument by its kind.

    Kind of every object must be carefully selected so that it shows the
    intention of design. Expressions may have different kind according
    to the kind of its arguments. For example, arguments of ``Add``
    must have common kind since addition is group operator, and the
    resulting ``Add()`` has the same kind.

    For the performance, each kind is as broad as possible and is not
    based on set theory. For example, ``NumberKind`` includes not only
    complex number but expression containing ``S.Infinity`` or ``S.NaN``
    which are not strictly number.

    Kind may have arguments as parameter. For example, ``MatrixKind()``
    may be constructed with one element which represents the kind of its
    elements.

    ``Kind`` behaves in singleton-like fashion. Same signature will
    return the same object.

    This kind represents every number, including complex numbers,

    Most ``Expr`` are initially designed to represent the number, so
    this will be the most common kind in SymPy core. For example
    ``Symbol()``, which represents a scalar, has this kind as long as it
    is commutative.

    Numbers form a field. Any operation between number-kind objects will
    result this kind as well.

    """
    Dispatcher to select a kind from multiple kinds by binary dispatching.

    .. notes::
       This approach is experimental, and can be replaced or deleted in
       the future.

    Explanation
    ===========

    SymPy object's :obj:`sympy.core.kind.Kind()` vaguely represents the
    algebraic structure where the object belongs to. Therefore, with
    given operation, we can always find a dominating kind among the
    different kinds. This class selects the kind by recursive binary
    dispatching. If the result cannot be determined, ``UndefinedKind``
    is returned.

    Examples
    ========

    Multiplication between numbers return number.

    >>> from sympy import NumberKind, Mul
    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(NumberKind, NumberKind)
    NumberKind

    Multiplication between number and unknown-kind object returns unknown kind.

    >>> from sympy import UndefinedKind
    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(NumberKind, UndefinedKind)
    UndefinedKind

    Any number and order of kinds is allowed.

    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(UndefinedKind, NumberKind)
    UndefinedKind
    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(NumberKind, UndefinedKind, NumberKind)
    UndefinedKind

    Since matrix forms a vector space over scalar field, multiplication
    between matrix with numeric element and number returns matrix with
    numeric element.

    >>> from sympy.matrices import MatrixKind
    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(MatrixKind(NumberKind), NumberKind)
    MatrixKind(NumberKind)

    If a matrix with number element and another matrix with unknown-kind
    element are multiplied, we know that the result is matrix but the
    kind of its elements is unknown.

    >>> Mul._kind_dispatcher(MatrixKind(NumberKind), MatrixKind(UndefinedKind))
    MatrixKind(UndefinedKind)
