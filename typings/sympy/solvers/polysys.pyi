def solve_generic(polys, opt, strict=...): # -> list[tuple[Any]] | None:
    """
    Solve a generic system of polynomial equations.

    Returns all possible solutions over C[x_1, x_2, ..., x_m] of a
    set F = { f_1, f_2, ..., f_n } of polynomial equations, using
    Groebner basis approach. For now only zero-dimensional systems
    are supported, which means F can have at most a finite number
    of solutions. If the basis contains only the ground, None is
    returned.

    The algorithm works by the fact that, supposing G is the basis
    of F with respect to an elimination order (here lexicographic
    order is used), G and F generate the same ideal, they have the
    same set of solutions. By the elimination property, if G is a
    reduced, zero-dimensional Groebner basis, then there exists an
    univariate polynomial in G (in its last variable). This can be
    solved by computing its roots. Substituting all computed roots
    for the last (eliminated) variable in other elements of G, new
    polynomial system is generated. Applying the above procedure
    recursively, a finite number of solutions can be found.

    The ability of finding all solutions by this procedure depends
    on the root finding algorithms. If no solutions were found, it
    means only that roots() failed, but the system is solvable. To
    overcome this difficulty use numerical algorithms instead.

    Parameters

    polys: a list/tuple/set

    """
    Factorizes a system of polynomial equations into
    irreducible subsystems.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs : list
        List of expressions to be factored.
        Each expression is assumed to be equal to zero.

    gens : list, optional
        Generator(s) of the polynomial ring.
        If not provided, all free symbols will be used.

    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Same optional arguments taken by ``factor``

    Returns
    =======

    list[list[Expr]]
        A list of lists of expressions, where each sublist represents
        an irreducible subsystem. When solved, each subsystem gives
        one component of the solution. Only generic solutions are
        returned (cases not requiring parameters to be zero).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.polysys import factor_system, factor_system_cond
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, a, b, c

    A simple system with multiple solutions:

    >>> factor_system([x**2 - 1, y - 1])
    [[x + 1, y - 1], [x - 1, y - 1]]

    A system with no solution:

    >>> factor_system([x, 1])
    []

    A system where any value of the symbol(s) is a solution:

    >>> factor_system([x - x, (x + 1)**2 - (x**2 + 2*x + 1)])
    [[]]

    A system with no generic solution:

    >>> factor_system([a*x*(x-1), b*y, c], [x, y])
    []

    If c is added to the unknowns then the system has a generic solution:

    >>> factor_system([a*x*(x-1), b*y, c], [x, y, c])
    [[x - 1, y, c], [x, y, c]]

    Alternatively :func:`factor_system_cond` can be used to get degenerate
    cases as well:

    >>> factor_system_cond([a*x*(x-1), b*y, c], [x, y])
    [[x - 1, y, c], [x, y, c], [x - 1, b, c], [x, b, c], [y, a, c], [a, b, c]]

    Each of the above cases is only satisfiable in the degenerate case `c = 0`.

    The solution set of the original system represented
    by eqs is the union of the solution sets of the
    factorized systems.

    An empty list [] means no generic solution exists.
    A list containing an empty list [[]] means any value of
    the symbol(s) is a solution.

def factor_system_bool(eqs: Sequence[Expr | complex], gens: Sequence[Expr] = ..., **kwargs: Any) -> Boolean:
    """
    Factorizes a system of polynomial equations into irreducible DNF.

    The system of expressions(eqs) is taken and a Boolean combination
    of equations is returned that represents the same solution set.
    The result is in disjunctive normal form (OR of ANDs).

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs : list
       List of expressions to be factored.
       Each expression is assumed to be equal to zero.

    gens : list, optional
       Generator(s) of the polynomial ring.
       If not provided, all free symbols will be used.

    **kwargs : dict, optional
       Optional keyword arguments


    Returns
    =======

    Boolean:
       A Boolean combination of equations. The result is typically in
       the form of a conjunction (AND) of a disjunctive normal form
       with additional conditions.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.polysys import factor_system_bool
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, a, b, c
    >>> factor_system_bool([x**2 - 1])
    Eq(x - 1, 0) | Eq(x + 1, 0)

    >>> factor_system_bool([x**2 + 2*x + 1 - (x + 1)**2])
    True

    The result is logically equivalent to the system of equations
    i.e. eqs. The function returns ``True`` when all values of
    the symbol(s) is a solution and ``False`` when the system
    cannot be solved.
