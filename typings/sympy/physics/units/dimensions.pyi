Definition of physical dimensions.

Unit systems will be constructed on top of these dimensions.

Most of the examples in the doc use MKS system and are presented from the
computer point of view: from a human point, adding length to time is not legal
in MKS but it is in natural system; for a computer in natural system there is
no time dimension (but a velocity dimension instead) - in the basis - so the
question of adding time to length has no meaning.

    This class represent the dimension of a physical quantities.

    The ``Dimension`` constructor takes as parameters a name and an optional
    symbol.

    For example, in classical mechanics we know that time is different from
    temperature and dimensions make this difference (but they do not provide
    any measure of these quantities.

        >>> from sympy.physics.units import Dimension
        >>> length = Dimension('length')
        >>> length
        Dimension(length)
        >>> time = Dimension('time')
        >>> time
        Dimension(time)

    Dimensions can be composed using multiplication, division and
    exponentiation (by a number) to give new dimensions. Addition and
    subtraction is defined only when the two objects are the same dimension.

        >>> velocity = length / time
        >>> velocity
        Dimension(length/time)

    It is possible to use a dimension system object to get the dimensionsal
    dependencies of a dimension, for example the dimension system used by the
    SI units convention can be used:

        >>> from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import dimsys_SI
        >>> dimsys_SI.get_dimensional_dependencies(velocity)
        {Dimension(length, L): 1, Dimension(time, T): -1}
        >>> length + length
        Dimension(length)
        >>> l2 = length**2
        >>> l2
        Dimension(length**2)
        >>> dimsys_SI.get_dimensional_dependencies(l2)
        {Dimension(length, L): 2}
