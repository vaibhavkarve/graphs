    Convert ``expr`` to the same expression with all of its units and quantities
    represented as factors of ``target_units``, whenever the dimension is compatible.

    ``target_units`` may be a single unit/quantity, or a collection of
    units/quantities.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.units import speed_of_light, meter, gram, second, day
    >>> from sympy.physics.units import mile, newton, kilogram, atomic_mass_constant
    >>> from sympy.physics.units import kilometer, centimeter
    >>> from sympy.physics.units import gravitational_constant, hbar
    >>> from sympy.physics.units import convert_to
    >>> convert_to(mile, kilometer)
    25146*kilometer/15625
    >>> convert_to(mile, kilometer).n()
    1.609344*kilometer

    >>> convert_to(day, second)

    >>> 3*newton

    >>> convert_to(3*newton, kilogram*meter/second**2)
    3*kilogram*meter/second**2
    >>> convert_to(atomic_mass_constant, gram)
    1.660539060e-24*gram

    Conversion to multiple units:

    >>> convert_to(speed_of_light, [meter, second])
    299792458*meter/second
    >>> convert_to(3*newton, [centimeter, gram, second])
    300000*centimeter*gram/second**2

    Conversion to Planck units:

    >>> convert_to(atomic_mass_constant, [gravitational_constant, speed_of_light, hbar]).n()
    7.62963087839509e-20*hbar**0.5*speed_of_light**0.5/gravitational_constant**0.5
