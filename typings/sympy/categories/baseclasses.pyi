class Class(Set):
    r"""
    The base class for any kind of class in the set-theoretic sense.

    Explanation
    ===========

    In axiomatic set theories, everything is a class.  A class which
    can be a member of another class is a set.  A class which is not a
    member of another class is a proper class.  The class `\{1, 2\}`
    is a set; the class of all sets is a proper class.

    This class is essentially a synonym for :class:`sympy.core.Set`.
    The goal of this class is to assure easier migration to the
    eventual proper implementation of set theory.

    The base class for any kind of object in an abstract category.

    Explanation
    ===========

    While technically any instance of :class:`~.Basic` will do, this
    class is the recommended way to create abstract objects in
    abstract categories.

class Morphism(Basic):
    """
    The base class for any morphism in an abstract category.

    Explanation
    ===========

    In abstract categories, a morphism is an arrow between two
    category objects.  The object where the arrow starts is called the
    domain, while the object where the arrow ends is called the
    codomain.

    Two morphisms between the same pair of objects are considered to
    be the same morphisms.  To distinguish between morphisms between
    the same objects use :class:`NamedMorphism`.

    It is prohibited to instantiate this class.  Use one of the
    derived classes instead.

    An (abstract) category.

    Explanation
    ===========

    A category [JoyOfCats] is a quadruple `\mbox{K} = (O, \hom, id,
    \circ)` consisting of

    * a (set-theoretical) class `O`, whose members are called
      `K`-objects,

    * for each pair `(A, B)` of `K`-objects, a set `\hom(A, B)` whose
      members are called `K`-morphisms from `A` to `B`,

    * for a each `K`-object `A`, a morphism `id:A\rightarrow A`,
      called the `K`-identity of `A`,

    * a composition law `\circ` associating with every `K`-morphisms
      `f:A\rightarrow B` and `g:B\rightarrow C` a `K`-morphism `g\circ
      f:A\rightarrow C`, called the composite of `f` and `g`.

    Composition is associative, `K`-identities are identities with
    respect to composition, and the sets `\hom(A, B)` are pairwise
    disjoint.

    This class knows nothing about its objects and morphisms.
    Concrete cases of (abstract) categories should be implemented as
    classes derived from this one.

    Certain instances of :class:`Diagram` can be asserted to be
    commutative in a :class:`Category` by supplying the argument
    ``commutative_diagrams`` in the constructor.

class Diagram(Basic):
    r"""
    Represents a diagram in a certain category.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Informally, a diagram is a collection of objects of a category and
    certain morphisms between them.  A diagram is still a monoid with
    respect to morphism composition; i.e., identity morphisms, as well
    as all composites of morphisms included in the diagram belong to
    the diagram.  For a more formal approach to this notion see
    [Pare1970].

    The components of composite morphisms are also added to the
    diagram.  No properties are assigned to such morphisms by default.

    A commutative diagram is often accompanied by a statement of the
    following kind: "if such morphisms with such properties exist,
    then such morphisms which such properties exist and the diagram is
    commutative".  To represent this, an instance of :class:`Diagram`
    includes a collection of morphisms which are the premises and
    another collection of conclusions.  ``premises`` and
    ``conclusions`` associate morphisms belonging to the corresponding
    categories with the :class:`~.FiniteSet`'s of their properties.

    The set of properties of a composite morphism is the intersection
    of the sets of properties of its components.  The domain and
    codomain of a conclusion morphism should be among the domains and
    codomains of the morphisms listed as the premises of a diagram.

    No checks are carried out of whether the supplied object and
    morphisms do belong to one and the same category.

    Examples

    >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism, Diagram

        If no arguments are supplied, an empty diagram is created.

        If at least an argument is supplied, ``args[0]`` is
        interpreted as the premises of the diagram.  If ``args[0]`` is

        If ``args[0]`` is a Python dictionary or a :class:`Dict`, it

        :class:`Morphism`'s some properties.

        If at least two arguments are supplied ``args[1]`` is
        interpreted as the conclusions of the diagram.  The type of

        Checks whether ``diagram`` is a subdiagram of ``self``.
        Diagram `D'` is a subdiagram of `D` if all premises
        (conclusions) of `D'` are contained in the premises
        (conclusions) of `D`.  The morphisms contained
        both in `D'` and `D` should have the same properties for `D'`
        to be a subdiagram of `D`.
