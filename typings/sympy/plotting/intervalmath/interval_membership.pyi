class intervalMembership:
    """Represents a boolean expression returned by the comparison of
    the interval object.

    Parameters
    ==========

    (a, b) : (bool, bool)
        The first value determines the comparison as follows:
        - True: If the comparison is True throughout the intervals.
        - False: If the comparison is False throughout the intervals.
        - None: If the comparison is True for some part of the intervals.

        The second value is determined as follows:
        - True: If both the intervals in comparison are valid.
        - False: If at least one of the intervals is False, else
        - None
