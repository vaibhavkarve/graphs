class VectorKind(Kind):
    """
    Kind for all vector objects in SymPy.

    Parameters
    ==========

    element_kind : Kind
        Kind of the element. Default is
        :class:`sympy.core.kind.NumberKind`,
        which means that the vector contains only numbers.

    Examples
    ========

    Any instance of Vector class has kind ``VectorKind``:

    >>> from sympy.vector.coordsysrect import CoordSys3D
    >>> Sys = CoordSys3D('Sys')
    >>> Sys.i.kind
    VectorKind(NumberKind)

    Operations between instances of Vector keep also have the kind ``VectorKind``:

    >>> from sympy.core.add import Add
    >>> v1 = Sys.i * 2 + Sys.j * 3 + Sys.k * 4
    >>> v2 = Sys.i * Sys.x + Sys.j * Sys.y + Sys.k * Sys.z
    >>> v1.kind
    VectorKind(NumberKind)
    >>> v2.kind
    VectorKind(NumberKind)
    >>> Add(v1, v2).kind
    VectorKind(NumberKind)

    Subclasses of Vector also have the kind ``VectorKind``, such as
    Cross, VectorAdd, VectorMul or VectorZero.
