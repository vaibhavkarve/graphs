        From the dot product of vectors v1 and v2 it is known that:

            ``dot(v1, v2) = |v1|*|v2|*cos(A)``

        where A is the angle formed between the two vectors. We can
        get the directional vectors of the two lines and readily
        find the angle between the two using the above formula.

        Notes
        =====

        A projection involves taking the two points that define
        the linear entity and projecting those points onto a
        Line and then reforming the linear entity using these
        projections.
        A point P is projected onto a line L by finding the point
        on L that is closest to P. This point is the intersection
        of L and the line perpendicular to L that passes through P.
