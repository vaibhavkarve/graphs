class Polygon(GeometrySet):
    """A two-dimensional polygon.

    A simple polygon in space. Can be constructed from a sequence of points
    or from a center, radius, number of sides and rotation angle.

    Parameters
    ==========

    vertices
        A sequence of points.

    n : int, optional
        If $> 0$, an n-sided RegularPolygon is created.
        Default value is $0$.

    Attributes

    area
    angles
    perimeter
    vertices
    centroid
    sides

    Raises
    ======

    GeometryError
        If all parameters are not Points.

    sympy.geometry.point.Point, sympy.geometry.line.Segment, Triangle

    Notes
    =====

    Polygons are treated as closed paths rather than 2D areas so
    some calculations can be be negative or positive (e.g., area)
    based on the orientation of the points.

    Any consecutive identical points are reduced to a single point
    and any points collinear and between two points will be removed
    unless they are needed to define an explicit intersection (see examples).

    A Triangle, Segment or Point will be returned when there are 3 or
    fewer points provided.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Polygon, pi
    >>> p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (5, 1), (0, 1), (3, 0)]
    >>> Polygon(p1, p2, p3, p4)
    Polygon(Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(1, 0), Point2D(5, 1), Point2D(0, 1))
    >>> Polygon(p1, p2)
    Segment2D(Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(1, 0))
    >>> Polygon(p1, p2, p5)
    Segment2D(Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(3, 0))

    The area of a polygon is calculated as positive when vertices are
    traversed in a ccw direction. When the sides of a polygon cross the
    area will have positive and negative contributions. The following
    defines a Z shape where the bottom right connects back to the top
    left.

    >>> Polygon((0, 2), (2, 2), (0, 0), (2, 0)).area
    0

    When the keyword `n` is used to define the number of sides of the
    Polygon then a RegularPolygon is created and the other arguments are
    interpreted as center, radius and rotation. The unrotated RegularPolygon
    will always have a vertex at Point(r, 0) where `r` is the radius of the
    circle that circumscribes the RegularPolygon. Its method `spin` can be
    used to increment that angle.

    >>> p = Polygon((0,0), 1, n=3)
    >>> p
    RegularPolygon(Point2D(0, 0), 1, 3, 0)
    >>> p.vertices[0]
    Point2D(1, 0)
    >>> p.args[0]
    Point2D(0, 0)
    >>> p.spin(pi/2)
    >>> p.vertices[0]

        Notes
        =====

        The area calculation can be positive or negative based on the
        orientation of the points. If any side of the polygon crosses
        any other side, there will be areas having opposite signs.

        Notes

        When iterating over the vertices, it is more efficient to index self

        vertices when you want to process all of them at once. This is even

        First moment of area is a measure of the distribution of the area

        the entire polygon about its own centroid is always zero. Therefore,

        is then determined about the centroidal axis of the initial polygon.

    A RegularPolygon can be instantiated with Polygon with the kwarg n.

    Regular polygons are instantiated with a center, radius, number of sides
    and a rotation angle. Whereas the arguments of a Polygon are vertices, the
    vertices of the RegularPolygon must be obtained with the vertices method.
