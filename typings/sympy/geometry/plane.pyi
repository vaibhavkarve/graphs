    A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface. A plane is the two-dimensional
    analogue of a point (zero-dimensions), a line (one-dimension) and a solid
    (three-dimensions). A plane can generally be constructed by two types of
    inputs. They are:
    - three non-collinear points
    - a point and the plane's normal vector
