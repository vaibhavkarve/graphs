class DiracDelta(DefinedFunction):
    r"""
    The DiracDelta function and its derivatives.

    Explanation
    ===========

    DiracDelta is not an ordinary function. It can be rigorously defined either
    as a distribution or as a measure.

    DiracDelta only makes sense in definite integrals, and in particular,
    integrals of the form ``Integral(f(x)*DiracDelta(x - x0), (x, a, b))``,
    where it equals ``f(x0)`` if ``a <= x0 <= b`` and ``0`` otherwise. Formally,
    DiracDelta acts in some ways like a function that is ``0`` everywhere except
    at ``0``, but in many ways it also does not. It can often be useful to treat
    DiracDelta in formal ways, building up and manipulating expressions with
    delta functions (which may eventually be integrated), but care must be taken
    to not treat it as a real function. SymPy's ``oo`` is similar. It only
    truly makes sense formally in certain contexts (such as integration limits),
    but SymPy allows its use everywhere, and it tries to be consistent with
    operations on it (like ``1/oo``), but it is easy to get into trouble and get
    wrong results if ``oo`` is treated too much like a number. Similarly, if
    DiracDelta is treated too much like a function, it is easy to get wrong or
    nonsensical results.

    DiracDelta function has the following properties:

    1) $\frac{d}{d x} \theta(x) = \delta(x)$
    2) $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(x - a)f(x)\, dx = f(a)$ and $\int_{a-
       \epsilon}^{a+\epsilon} \delta(x - a)f(x)\, dx = f(a)$
    3) $\delta(x) = 0$ for all $x \neq 0$
    4) $\delta(g(x)) = \sum_i \frac{\delta(x - x_i)}{\|g'(x_i)\|}$ where $x_i$
       are the roots of $g$
    5) $\delta(-x) = \delta(x)$

    Derivatives of ``k``-th order of DiracDelta have the following properties:

    6) $\delta(x, k) = 0$ for all $x \neq 0$
    7) $\delta(-x, k) = -\delta(x, k)$ for odd $k$
    8) $\delta(-x, k) = \delta(x, k)$ for even $k$

        Returns the first derivative of a DiracDelta Function.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The difference between ``diff()`` and ``fdiff()`` is: ``diff()`` is the
        user-level function and ``fdiff()`` is an object method. ``fdiff()`` is
        a convenience method available in the ``Function`` class. It returns
        the derivative of the function without considering the chain rule.
        ``diff(function, x)`` calls ``Function._eval_derivative`` which in turn
        calls ``fdiff()`` internally to compute the derivative of the function.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import DiracDelta, diff
        >>> from sympy.abc import x

        >>> DiracDelta(x).fdiff()

        DiracDelta(x, 2)

        DiracDelta(x**2 - 1, 1)

        Returns a simplified form or a value of DiracDelta depending on the

        Explanation
        ===========

        The ``eval()`` method is automatically called when the ``DiracDelta``
        class is about to be instantiated and it returns either some simplified
        instance or the unevaluated instance depending on the argument passed.

        it is being called and evaluated once the object is called.

class Heaviside(DefinedFunction):
    r"""
    Heaviside step function.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The Heaviside step function has the following properties:

    1) $\frac{d}{d x} \theta(x) = \delta(x)$
    2) $\theta(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{for}\: x < 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} &
       \text{for}\: x = 0 \\1 & \text{for}\: x > 0 \end{cases}$
    3) $\frac{d}{d x} \max(x, 0) = \theta(x)$

    Heaviside(x) is printed as $\theta(x)$ with the SymPy LaTeX printer.

    The value at 0 is set differently in different fields. SymPy uses 1/2,
    which is a convention from electronics and signal processing, and is
    consistent with solving improper integrals by Fourier transform and
    convolution.

    To specify a different value of Heaviside at ``x=0``, a second argument
    can be given. Using ``Heaviside(x, nan)`` gives an expression that will
    evaluate to nan for x=0.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9 ``Heaviside(0)`` now returns 1/2 (before: undefined)

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Heaviside, nan
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> Heaviside(9)
    1
    >>> Heaviside(-9)
    0
    >>> Heaviside(0)
    1/2
    >>> Heaviside(0, nan)
    nan
    >>> (Heaviside(x) + 1).replace(Heaviside(x), Heaviside(x, 1))
    Heaviside(x, 1) + 1
