    """
    Separates variables in an expression, if possible.  By
    default, it separates with respect to all symbols in an
    expression and collects constant coefficients that are
    independent of symbols.

    Explanation
    ===========

    If ``dict=True`` then the separated terms will be returned
    in a dictionary keyed to their corresponding symbols.
    By default, all symbols in the expression will appear as
    keys; if symbols are provided, then all those symbols will
    be used as keys, and any terms in the expression containing
    other symbols or non-symbols will be returned keyed to the
    string 'coeff'. (Passing None for symbols will return the
    expression in a dictionary keyed to 'coeff'.)

    If ``force=True``, then bases of powers will be separated regardless
    of assumptions on the symbols involved.

    Notes
    =====

    The order of the factors is determined by Mul, so that the
    separated expressions may not necessarily be grouped together.

    Although factoring is necessary to separate variables in some
    expressions, it is not necessary in all cases, so one should not
    count on the returned factors being factored.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, alpha

    >>> separatevars((x*y)**y)
    (x*y)**y

    x**y*y**y

    >>> e = 2*x**2*z*sin(y)+2*z*x**2
    >>> separatevars(e)
    2*x**2*z*(sin(y) + 1)
    >>> separatevars(e, symbols=(x, y), dict=True)
    {'coeff': 2*z, x: x**2, y: sin(y) + 1}
    >>> separatevars(e, [x, y, alpha], dict=True)
    {'coeff': 2*z, alpha: 1, x: x**2, y: sin(y) + 1}

    If the expression is not really separable, or is only partially
    separable, separatevars will do the best it can to separate it
    by using factoring.

    >>> separatevars(x + x*y - 3*x**2)
    -x*(3*x - y - 1)

    If the expression is not separable then expr is returned unchanged
    or (if dict=True) then None is returned.

    >>> eq = 2*x + y*sin(x)

    If an Add subexpression, ``a``, can have a sign extracted,

def simplify(expr, ratio=..., measure=..., rational=..., inverse=..., doit=..., **kwargs):
    """Simplifies the given expression.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies
    this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If
    your algorithm relies on "simplification" (whatever it is), try to
    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,
    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular
    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm
    will be robust.

    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you do not know
    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply
    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression "simpler".  For
    example:

    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
    >>> a
    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
    >>> simplify(a)
    x + 1

    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific
    simplification functions:

    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel
    >>> trigsimp(a)
    (x**2 + x)/x
    >>> cancel(_)
    x + 1

    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more
    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme
    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned
    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used
    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a
    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if
    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then
    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is
    :func:`~.count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the
    expression.

    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output cannot be longer
    than input.

    ::

        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo
        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)

    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,
    root is returned unchanged instead::

       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root
       True

    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::

        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)
        True

    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so
    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.
    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable
    choice.

    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel
    should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note
    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be
    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function
    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you do not
    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good
    one.

    For example:

    >>> from sympy import symbols, log
    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)
    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)
    >>> h = simplify(g)
    >>> h
    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))
    >>> count_ops(g)
    8
    >>> count_ops(h)
    5

    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.
    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using
    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way
    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in
    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:

    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))
    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL
    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))
    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S
    >>> def my_measure(expr):
    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')
    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10
    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)
    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)
    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))
    ...     return count
    >>> my_measure(g)
    8
    >>> my_measure(h)
    14
    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio
    True
    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)
    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)

    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different
    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure
    function, we get a completely different result that is still different
    from the input expression by doing this.

    If ``rational=True``, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.
    If ``rational=None``, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will
    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done
    to the Floats.

    If ``inverse=True``, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse
    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.
    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether
    x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is
    False.

    Note that ``simplify()`` automatically calls ``doit()`` on the final
    expression. You can avoid this behavior by passing ``doit=False`` as
    an argument.

    Also, it should be noted that simplifying a boolean expression is not
    well defined. If the expression prefers automatic evaluation (such as
    :obj:`~.Eq()` or :obj:`~.Or()`), simplification will return ``True`` or
    ``False`` if truth value can be determined. If the expression is not
    evaluated by default (such as :obj:`~.Predicate()`), simplification will
    not reduce it and you should use :func:`~.refine` or :func:`~.ask`
    function. This inconsistency will be resolved in future version.

    For numerical expressions, a simple formula that numerically matches the

    Optionally, a list of (rationally independent) constants to

    A lower tolerance may be set to find less exact matches. If no tolerance

    With ``full=True``, a more extensive search is performed
    (this is useful to find simpler numbers when the tolerance
    is set low).

    When converting to rational, if rational_conversion='base10' (the default), then

def dotprodsimp(expr, withsimp=...):
    """Simplification for a sum of products targeted at the kind of blowup that
    occurs during summation of products. Intended to reduce expression blowup
    during matrix multiplication or other similar operations. Only works with
    algebraic expressions and does not recurse into non.

    Parameters
    ==========

    withsimp : bool, optional
        Specifies whether a flag should be returned along with the expression
        to indicate roughly whether simplification was successful. It is used
        in ``MatrixArithmetic._eval_pow_by_recursion`` to avoid attempting to
        simplify an expression repetitively which does not simplify.
