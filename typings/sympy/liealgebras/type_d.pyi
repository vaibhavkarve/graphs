        Every lie algebra has a unique root system.
        Given a root system Q, there is a subset of the
        roots such that an element of Q is called a
        simple root if it cannot be written as the sum
        of two elements in Q.  If we let D denote the
        set of simple roots, then it is clear that every
        element of Q can be written as a linear combination
        of elements of D with all coefficients non-negative.

        In D_n, the first n-1 simple roots are the same as
        the roots in A_(n-1) (a 1 in the ith position, a -1
        in the (i+1)th position, and zeroes elsewhere).
        The nth simple root is the root in which there 1s in
        the nth and (n-1)th positions, and zeroes elsewhere.

        This method returns the ith simple root for the D series.
