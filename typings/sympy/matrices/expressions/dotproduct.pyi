    Dot product of vector matrices

    The input should be two 1 x n or n x 1 matrices. The output represents the
    scalar dotproduct.

    This is similar to using MatrixElement and MatMul, except DotProduct does
    not require that one vector to be a row vector and the other vector to be
    a column vector.

    DotProduct(A, B)
    >>> DotProduct(A, B).doit()
