    Calculate the partition function P(n), i.e. the number of ways that
    n can be written as a sum of positive integers.

    .. deprecated:: 1.13

        The ``npartitions`` function is deprecated. Use :class:`sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers.partition`
        instead. See its documentation for more information. See
        :ref:`deprecated-ntheory-symbolic-functions` for details.

    P(n) is computed using the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula [1]_.


    The correctness of this implementation has been tested through $10^{10}$.
