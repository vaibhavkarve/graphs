def continued_fraction_periodic(p, q, d=..., s=...) -> list:
    r"""
    Find the periodic continued fraction expansion of a quadratic irrational.

    Compute the continued fraction expansion of a rational or a
    quadratic irrational number, i.e. `\frac{p + s\sqrt{d}}{q}`, where
    `p`, `q \ne 0` and `d \ge 0` are integers.

    Returns the continued fraction representation (canonical form) as
    a list of integers, optionally ending (for quadratic irrationals)
    with list of integers representing the repeating digits.

    Parameters
    ==========

    p : int
        the rational part of the number's numerator
    q : int
        the denominator of the number
    d : int, optional
        the irrational part (discriminator) of the number's numerator
    s : int, optional
        the coefficient of the irrational part

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.continued_fraction import continued_fraction_periodic
    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(3, 2, 7)
    [2, [1, 4, 1, 1]]

    Golden ratio has the simplest continued fraction expansion:

    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(1, 2, 5)
    [[1]]

    If the discriminator is zero or a perfect square then the number will be a
    rational number:

    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(4, 3, 0)
    [1, 3]
    >>> continued_fraction_periodic(4, 3, 49)
    [3, 1, 2]

def continued_fraction_reduce(cf): # -> Expr | Zero:
    """
    Reduce a continued fraction to a rational or quadratic irrational.

    Compute the rational or quadratic irrational number from its
    terminating or periodic continued fraction expansion.  The
    continued fraction expansion (cf) should be supplied as a
    terminating iterator supplying the terms of the expansion.  For
    terminating continued fractions, this is equivalent to
    ``list(continued_fraction_convergents(cf))[-1]``, only a little more
    efficient.  If the expansion has a repeating part, a list of the
    repeating terms should be returned as the last element from the
    iterator.  This is the format returned by
    continued_fraction_periodic.

    For quadratic irrationals, returns the largest solution found,
    which is generally the one sought, if the fraction is in canonical
    form (all terms positive except possibly the first).

def continued_fraction_convergents(cf): # -> Generator[Any, Any, None]:
    """
    Return an iterator over the convergents of a continued fraction (cf).

    The parameter should be in either of the following to forms:
    - A list of partial quotients, possibly with the last element being a list
    of repeating partial quotients, such as might be returned by
    continued_fraction and continued_fraction_periodic.
    - An iterable returning successive partial quotients of the continued
    fraction, such as might be returned by continued_fraction_iterator.

    In computing the convergents, the continued fraction need not be strictly
    in canonical form (all integers, all but the first positive).
    Rational and negative elements may be present in the expansion.
