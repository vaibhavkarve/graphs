Algorithms and classes to support enumerative combinatorics.

Currently just multiset partitions, but more could be added.

Terminology (following Knuth, algorithm 7.1.2.5M TAOCP)
*multiset* aaabbcccc has a *partition* aaabc | bccc

The submultisets, aaabc and bccc of the partition are called
*parts*, or sometimes *vectors*.  (Knuth notes that multiset
partitions can be thought of as partitions of vectors of integers,
where the ith element of the vector gives the multiplicity of
element i.)

The values a, b and c are *components* of the multiset.  These
correspond to elements of a set, but in a multiset can be present
with a multiplicity greater than 1.

The algorithm deserves some explanation.

Think of the part aaabc from the multiset above.  If we impose an
ordering on the components of the multiset, we can represent a part
with a vector, in which the value of the first element of the vector
corresponds to the multiplicity of the first component in that
part. Thus, aaabc can be represented by the vector [3, 1, 1].  We
can also define an ordering on parts, based on the lexicographic
ordering of the vector (leftmost vector element, i.e., the element
with the smallest component number, is the most significant), so
that [3, 1, 1] > [3, 1, 0] and [3, 1, 1] > [2, 1, 4].  The ordering
on parts can be extended to an ordering on partitions: First, sort
the parts in each partition, left-to-right in decreasing order. Then
partition A is greater than partition B if A's leftmost/greatest
part is greater than B's leftmost part.  If the leftmost parts are
equal, compare the second parts, and so on.

In this ordering, the greatest partition of a given multiset has only
one part.  The least partition is the one in which the components
are spread out, one per part.

The enumeration algorithms in this file yield the partitions of the
argument multiset in decreasing order.  The main data structure is a
stack of parts, corresponding to the current partition.  An
important invariant is that the parts on the stack are themselves in
decreasing order.  This data structure is decremented to find the
next smaller partition.  Most often, decrementing the partition will
only involve adjustments to the smallest parts at the top of the
stack, much as adjacent integers *usually* differ only in their last
few digits.

Knuth's algorithm uses two main operations on parts:

Decrement - change the part so that it is smaller in the
  (vector) lexicographic order, but reduced by the smallest amount possible.
  For example, if the multiset has vector [5,
  3, 1], and the bottom/greatest part is [4, 2, 1], this part would
  decrement to [4, 2, 0], while [4, 0, 0] would decrement to [3, 3,
  1].  A singleton part is never decremented -- [1, 0, 0] is not
  decremented to [0, 3, 1].  Instead, the decrement operator needs
  to fail for this case.  In Knuth's pseudocode, the decrement
  operator is step m5.

Spread unallocated multiplicity - Once a part has been decremented,
  it cannot be the rightmost part in the partition.  There is some
  multiplicity that has not been allocated, and new parts must be
  created above it in the stack to use up this multiplicity.  To
  maintain the invariant that the parts on the stack are in
  decreasing order, these new parts must be less than or equal to
  the decremented part.
  For example, if the multiset is [5, 3, 1], and its most
  significant part has just been decremented to [5, 3, 0], the
  spread operation will add a new part so that the stack becomes
  [[5, 3, 0], [0, 0, 1]].  If the most significant part (for the
  same multiset) has been decremented to [2, 0, 0] the stack becomes
  [[2, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [1, 3, 1]].  In the pseudocode, the spread
  operation for one part is step m2.  The complete spread operation
  is a loop of steps m2 and m3.

In order to facilitate the spread operation, Knuth stores, for each
component of each part, not just the multiplicity of that component
in the part, but also the total multiplicity available for this
component in this part or any lesser part above it on the stack.

One added twist is that Knuth does not represent the part vectors as
arrays. Instead, he uses a sparse representation, in which a
component of a part is represented as a component number (c), plus
the multiplicity of the component in that part (v) as well as the
total multiplicity available for that component (u).  This saves
time that would be spent skipping over zeros.

    multiplicities

    Yields
    ======

    state
        Internal data structure which encodes a particular partition.
        This output is then usually processed by a visitor function
        which combines the information from this data structure with
        the components themselves to produce an actual partition.

        Unless they wish to create their own visitor function, users will
        have little need to look inside this data structure.  But, for
        reference, it is a 3-element list with components:

        f
            is a frame array, which is used to divide pstack into parts.

        lpart
            points to the base of the topmost part.

        pstack
            is an array of PartComponent objects.

        The ``state`` output offers a peek into the internal data
        structures of the enumeration function.  The client should
        treat this as read-only; any modification of the data
        structure will cause unpredictable (and almost certainly
        incorrect) results.  Also, the components of ``state`` are
        modified in place at each iteration.  Hence, the visitor must
        be called at each loop iteration.  Accumulating the ``state``
        instances and processing them later will not work.

        Notes
        =====

        The goal of this modification of the ordinary decrement method
        is to fail (meaning that the subtree rooted at this part is to
        be skipped) when it can be proved that this part can only have
        child partitions which are larger than allowed by ``ub``. If a
        decision is made to fail, it must be accurate, otherwise the
        enumeration will miss some partitions.  But, it is OK not to
        capture all the possible failures -- if a part is passed that
        should not be, the resulting too-large partitions are filtered
        by the enumeration one level up.  However, as is usual in
        constrained enumerations, failing early is advantageous.

        The tests used by this method catch the most common cases,
        although this implementation is by no means the last word on
        this problem.  The tests include:

        1) ``lpart`` must be less than ``ub`` by at least 2.  This is because
           once a part has been decremented, the partition
           will gain at least one child in the spread step.

        2) If the leading component of the part is about to be
           decremented, check for how many parts will be added in
           order to use up the unallocated multiplicity in that
           leading component, and fail if this number is greater than
           allowed by ``ub``.  (See code for the exact expression.)  This
           test is given in the answer to Knuth's problem 7.2.1.5.69.

        3) If there is *exactly* enough room to expand the leading
           component by the above test, check the next component (if
           it exists) once decrementing has finished.  If this has
           ``v == 0``, this next component will push the expansion over the
           limit by 1, so fail.

        multisets, the object should be cleared to save memory.  On
        the other hand, the cache built up from one count run can
        significantly speed up subsequent calls to ``count_partitions``,
        so it may be advantageous not to clear the object.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.utilities.enumerative import MultisetPartitionTraverser
        >>> m = MultisetPartitionTraverser()
        >>> m.count_partitions([9,8,2])
        288716
        >>> m.count_partitions([2,2])
        9
        >>> del m

        Notes
        =====

        If one looks at the workings of Knuth's algorithm M [AOCP]_, it
        can be viewed as a traversal of a binary tree of parts.  A
        part has (up to) two children, the left child resulting from
        the spread operation, and the right child from the decrement
        operation.  The ordinary enumeration of multiset partitions is
        an in-order traversal of this tree, and with the partitions
        corresponding to paths from the root to the leaves. The
        mapping from paths to partitions is a little complicated,
        since the partition would contain only those parts which are
        leaves or the parents of a spread link, not those which are
        parents of a decrement link.

        For counting purposes, it is sufficient to count leaves, and
        this can be done with a recursive in-order traversal.  The
        number of leaves of a subtree rooted at a particular part is a
        function only of that part itself, so memoizing has the
        potential to speed up the counting dramatically.

        This method follows a computational approach which is similar
        to the hypothetical memoized recursive function, but with two
        differences:

        1) This method is iterative, borrowing its structure from the
           other enumerations and maintaining an explicit stack of
           parts which are in the process of being counted.  (There
           may be multisets which can be counted reasonably quickly by
           this implementation, but which would overflow the default
           Python recursion limit with a recursive implementation.)

        2) Instead of using the part data structure directly, a more
           compact key is constructed.  This saves space, but more
           importantly coalesces some parts which would remain
           separate with physical keys.

        Unlike the enumeration functions, there is currently no _range
        version of count_partitions.  If someone wants to stretch
        their brain, it should be possible to construct one by
        memoizing with a histogram of counts rather than a single
        count, and combining the histograms.

    =====

    This member function is a candidate for future exploration. There

    ``part_key`` values, and thereby save space and improve
    performance.
