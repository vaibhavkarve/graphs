    Roots of a univariate polynomial separated into disjoint
    real or complex intervals and indexed in a fixed order:

    * real roots come first and are sorted in increasing order;
    * complex roots come next and are sorted primarily by increasing
      real part, secondarily by increasing imaginary part.

    Currently only rational coefficients are allowed.
    Can be imported as ``CRootOf``. To avoid confusion, the
    generator must be a Symbol.


    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import CRootOf, rootof
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    CRootOf is a way to reference a particular root of a
    polynomial. If there is a rational root, it will be returned:

    >>> CRootOf.clear_cache()  # for doctest reproducibility
    >>> CRootOf(x**2 - 4, 0)
    -2

    Whether roots involving radicals are returned or not
    depends on whether the ``radicals`` flag is true (which is
    set to True with rootof):

    >>> CRootOf(x**2 - 3, 0)
    CRootOf(x**2 - 3, 0)
    >>> CRootOf(x**2 - 3, 0, radicals=True)
    -sqrt(3)
    >>> rootof(x**2 - 3, 0)
    -sqrt(3)

    The following cannot be expressed in terms of radicals:

    >>> r = rootof(4*x**5 + 16*x**3 + 12*x**2 + 7, 0); r
    CRootOf(4*x**5 + 16*x**3 + 12*x**2 + 7, 0)

    The root bounds can be seen, however, and they are used by the
    evaluation methods to get numerical approximations for the root.

    >>> interval = r._get_interval(); interval
    (-1, 0)
    >>> r.evalf(2)
    -0.98

    The evalf method refines the width of the root bounds until it
    guarantees that any decimal approximation within those bounds
    will satisfy the desired precision. It then stores the refined
    interval so subsequent requests at or below the requested
    precision will not have to recompute the root bounds and will
    return very quickly.

    Before evaluation above, the interval was

    >>> interval
    (-1, 0)

    After evaluation it is now

    >>> r._get_interval() # doctest: +SKIP
    (-165/169, -206/211)

    To reset all intervals for a given polynomial, the :meth:`_reset` method
    can be called from any CRootOf instance of the polynomial:

    >>> r._reset()
    >>> r._get_interval()
    (-1, 0)

    The :meth:`eval_approx` method will also find the root to a given
    precision but the interval is not modified unless the search
    for the root fails to converge within the root bounds. And
    the secant method is used to find the root. (The ``evalf``
    method uses bisection and will always update the interval.)

    >>> r.eval_approx(2)
    -0.98

    The interval needed to be slightly updated to find that root:

    >>> r._get_interval()
    (-1, -1/2)

    The ``evalf_rational`` will compute a rational approximation
    of the root to the desired accuracy or precision.

    >>> r.eval_rational(n=2)
    -69629/71318

    >>> t = CRootOf(x**3 + 10*x + 1, 1)
    >>> t.eval_rational(1e-1)
    15/256 - 805*I/256
    >>> t.eval_rational(1e-1, 1e-4)
    3275/65536 - 414645*I/131072
    >>> t.eval_rational(1e-4, 1e-4)
    6545/131072 - 414645*I/131072
    >>> t.eval_rational(n=2)
    104755/2097152 - 6634255*I/2097152

    Notes
    =====

    Although a PurePoly can be constructed from a non-symbol generator
    RootOf instances of non-symbols are disallowed to avoid confusion
    over what root is being represented.

    >>> from sympy import exp, PurePoly
    >>> PurePoly(x) == PurePoly(exp(x))
    True
    >>> CRootOf(x - 1, 0)

        The interval is refined with bisection and is sure to

        is complete so recalculation at the same or lesser precision
        will not have to repeat the refinement and should be much

        The following example first obtains Rational approximation to
        1e-8 accuracy for all roots of the 4-th order Legendre
        polynomial. Since the roots are all less than 1, this will
        ensure the decimal representation of the approximation will be
