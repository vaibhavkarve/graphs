Galois resolvents

Each of the functions in ``sympy.polys.numberfields.galoisgroups`` that
computes Galois groups for a particular degree $n$ uses resolvents. Given the
polynomial $T$ whose Galois group is to be computed, a resolvent is a
polynomial $R$ whose roots are defined as functions of the roots of $T$.

One way to compute the coefficients of $R$ is by approximating the roots of $T$
to sufficient precision. This module defines a :py:class:`~.Resolvent` class
that handles this job, determining the necessary precision, and computing $R$.

In some cases, the coefficients of $R$ are symmetric in the roots of $T$,
meaning they are equal to fixed functions of the coefficients of $T$. Therefore
another approach is to compute these functions once and for all, and record
them in a lookup table. This module defines code that can compute such tables.
The tables for polynomials $T$ of degrees 4 through 6, produced by this code,
are recorded in the resolvent_lookup.py module.

class Resolvent:
    r"""
    If $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$,
    $F$ a multivariate polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$,
    $H$ the stabilizer of $F$ in $G$ (i.e. the permutations $\sigma$ such that
    $F(X_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, X_{\sigma(n)}) = F(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$), and $s$
    a set of left coset representatives of $H$ in $G$, then the resolvent
    polynomial $R(Y)$ is the product over $\sigma \in s$ of
    $Y - F(X_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, X_{\sigma(n)})$.

    For example, consider the resolvent for the form
    $$F = X_0 X_2 + X_1 X_3$$
    and the group $G = S_4$. In this case, the stabilizer $H$ is the dihedral
    group $D4 = < (0123), (02) >$, and a set of representatives of $G/H$ is
    $\{I, (01), (03)\}$. The resolvent can be constructed as follows:

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation
    >>> from sympy.core.symbol import symbols
    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.galoisgroups import Resolvent
    >>> X = symbols('X0 X1 X2 X3')
    >>> F = X[0]*X[2] + X[1]*X[3]
    >>> s = [Permutation([0, 1, 2, 3]), Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3]),
    ... Permutation([3, 1, 2, 0])]
    >>> R = Resolvent(F, X, s)

    This resolvent has three roots, which are the conjugates of ``F`` under the
    three permutations in ``s``:

    >>> R.root_lambdas[0](*X)
    X0*X2 + X1*X3
    >>> R.root_lambdas[1](*X)
    X0*X3 + X1*X2
    >>> R.root_lambdas[2](*X)
    X0*X1 + X2*X3

    Resolvents are useful for computing Galois groups. Given a polynomial $T$
    of degree $n$, we will use a resolvent $R$ where $Gal(T) \leq G \leq S_n$.
    We will then want to substitute the roots of $T$ for the variables $X_i$
    in $R$, and study things like the discriminant of $R$, and the way $R$
    factors over $\mathbb{Q}$.

    From the symmetry in $R$'s construction, and since $Gal(T) \leq G$, we know
    from Galois theory that the coefficients of $R$ must lie in $\mathbb{Z}$.
    This allows us to compute the coefficients of $R$ by approximating the
    roots of $T$ to sufficient precision, plugging these values in for the
    variables $X_i$ in the coefficient expressions of $R$, and then simply
    rounding to the nearest integer.

    In order to determine a sufficient precision for the roots of $T$, this
    ``Resolvent`` class imposes certain requirements on the form ``F``. It
    could be possible to design a different ``Resolvent`` class, that made
    different precision estimates, and different assumptions about ``F``.

    ``F`` must be homogeneous, and all terms must have unit coefficient.
    Furthermore, if $r$ is the number of terms in ``F``, and $t$ the total
    degree, and if $m$ is the number of conjugates of ``F``, i.e. the number
    of permutations in ``s``, then we require that $m < r 2^t$. Again, it is
    not impossible to work with forms ``F`` that violate these assumptions, but
    this ``Resolvent`` class requires them.

    Since determining the integer coefficients of the resolvent for a given
    polynomial $T$ is one of the main problems this class solves, we take some
    time to explain the precision bounds it uses.

    The general problem is:
    Given a multivariate polynomial $P \in \mathbb{Z}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, and a
    bound $M \in \mathbb{R}_+$, compute an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that for any
    complex numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ with $|a_i| < M$, if the $a_i$ are
    approximated to within an accuracy of $\varepsilon$ by $b_i$, that is,
    $|a_i - b_i| < \varepsilon$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, then
    $|P(a_1, \ldots, a_n) - P(b_1, \ldots, b_n)| < 1/2$. In other words, if it
    is known that $P(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$, then
    $P(b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ can be rounded to the nearest integer in order to
    determine $c$.

    To derive our error bound, consider the monomial $xyz$. Defining
    $d_i = b_i - a_i$, our error is
    $|(a_1 + d_1)(a_2 + d_2)(a_3 + d_3) - a_1 a_2 a_3|$, which is bounded
    above by $|(M + \varepsilon)^3 - M^3|$. Passing to a general monomial of
    total degree $t$, this expression is bounded by
    $M^{t-1}\varepsilon(t + 2^t\varepsilon/M)$ provided $\varepsilon < M$,
    and by $(t+1)M^{t-1}\varepsilon$ provided $\varepsilon < M/2^t$.
    But since our goal is to make the error less than $1/2$, we will choose
    $\varepsilon < 1/(2(t+1)M^{t-1})$, which implies the condition that
    $\varepsilon < M/2^t$, as long as $M \geq 2$.

    Passing from the general monomial to the general polynomial is easy, by
    scaling and summing error bounds.

    In our specific case, we are given a homogeneous polynomial $F$ of
    $r$ terms and total degree $t$, all of whose coefficients are $\pm 1$. We
    are given the $m$ permutations that make the conjugates of $F$, and
    we want to bound the error in the coefficients of the monic polynomial
    $R(Y)$ having $F$ and its conjugates as roots (i.e. the resolvent).

    For $j$ from $1$ to $m$, the coefficient of $Y^{m-j}$ in $R(Y)$ is the
    $j$th elementary symmetric polynomial in the conjugates of $F$. This sums
    the products of these conjugates, taken $j$ at a time, in all possible
    combinations. There are $\binom{m}{j}$ such combinations, and each product
    of $j$ conjugates of $F$ expands to a sum of $r^j$ terms, each of unit
    coefficient, and total degree $jt$. An error bound for the $j$th coeff of
    $R$ is therefore
    $$\binom{m}{j} r^j (jt + 1) M^{jt - 1} \varepsilon$$
    When our goal is to evaluate all the coefficients of $R$, we will want to
    use the maximum of these error bounds. It is clear that this bound is
    strictly increasing for $j$ up to the ceiling of $m/2$. After that point,
    the first factor $\binom{m}{j}$ begins to decrease, while the others
    continue to increase. However, the binomial coefficient never falls by more
    than a factor of $1/m$ at a time, so our assumptions that $M \geq 2$ and
    $m < r 2^t$ are enough to tell us that the constant coefficient of $R$,
    i.e. that where $j = m$, has the largest error bound. Therefore we can use
    $$r^m (mt + 1) M^{mt - 1} \varepsilon$$
    as our error bound for all the coefficients.

    Note that this bound is also (more than) adequate to determine whether any
    of the roots of $R$ is an integer. Each of these roots is a single
    conjugate of $F$, which contains less error than the trace, i.e. the
    coefficient of $Y^{m - 1}$. By rounding the roots of $R$ to the nearest
    integers, we therefore get all the candidates for integer roots of $R$. By
    plugging these candidates into $R$, we can check whether any of them
    actually is a root.

    Note: We take the definition of resolvent from Cohen, but the error bound
    is ours.
