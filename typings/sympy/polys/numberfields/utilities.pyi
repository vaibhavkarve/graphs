def extract_fundamental_discriminant(a): # -> tuple[dict[Any, Any], dict[int, int]] | tuple[dict[Any, Any], dict[Any, Any]]:
    r"""
    Extract a fundamental discriminant from an integer *a*.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given any rational integer *a* that is 0 or 1 mod 4, write $a = d f^2$,
    where $d$ is either 1 or a fundamental discriminant, and return a pair
    of dictionaries ``(D, F)`` giving the prime factorizations of $d$ and $f$
    respectively, in the same format returned by :py:func:`~.factorint`.

    A fundamental discriminant $d$ is different from unity, and is either
    1 mod 4 and squarefree, or is 0 mod 4 and such that $d/4$ is squarefree
    and 2 or 3 mod 4. This is the same as being the discriminant of some
    quadratic field.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import extract_fundamental_discriminant
    >>> print(extract_fundamental_discriminant(-432))
    ({3: 1, -1: 1}, {2: 2, 3: 1})

    For comparison:

    >>> from sympy import factorint
    >>> print(factorint(-432))
    {2: 4, 3: 3, -1: 1}

    Parameters
    ==========

    a: int, must be 0 or 1 mod 4

    Returns
    =======

    Pair ``(D, F)``  of dictionaries.

    Raises
    ======

    ValueError
        If *a* is not 0 or 1 mod 4.

class AlgIntPowers:
    r"""
    Compute the powers of an algebraic integer.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given an algebraic integer $\theta$ by its monic irreducible polynomial
    ``T`` over :ref:`ZZ`, this class computes representations of arbitrarily
    high powers of $\theta$, as :ref:`ZZ`-linear combinations over
    $\{1, \theta, \ldots, \theta^{n-1}\}$, where $n = \deg(T)$.

    The representations are computed using the linear recurrence relations for
    powers of $\theta$, derived from the polynomial ``T``. See [1], Sec. 4.2.2.

    Optionally, the representations may be reduced with respect to a modulus.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Poly, cyclotomic_poly
    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import AlgIntPowers
    >>> T = Poly(cyclotomic_poly(5))
    >>> zeta_pow = AlgIntPowers(T)
    >>> print(zeta_pow[0])
    [1, 0, 0, 0]
    >>> print(zeta_pow[1])

def coeff_search(m, R): # -> Generator[Any, Any, NoReturn]:

    Generate coefficients for searching through polynomials.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Lead coeff is always non-negative. Explore all combinations with coeffs
    bounded in absolute value before increasing the bound. Skip the all-zero
    list, and skip any repeats. See examples.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import coeff_search
    >>> cs = coeff_search(2, 1)
    >>> C = [next(cs) for i in range(13)]

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : int
        Length of coeff list.
    R : int
        Initial max abs val for coeffs (will increase as search proceeds).

def supplement_a_subspace(M):
    r"""
    Extend a basis for a subspace to a basis for the whole space.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given an $n \times r$ matrix *M* of rank $r$ (so $r \leq n$), this function
    computes an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $B$ such that the first $r$
    columns of $B$ equal *M*.

    This operation can be interpreted as a way of extending a basis for a
    subspace, to give a basis for the whole space.

    To be precise, suppose you have an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, with
    basis $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$, and an $r$-dimensional subspace $W$ of
    $V$, spanned by a basis $\{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_r\}$, where the $w_j$ are
    given as linear combinations of the $v_i$. If the columns of *M* represent
    the $w_j$ as such linear combinations, then the columns of the matrix $B$
    computed by this function give a new basis $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ for
    $V$, again relative to the $\{v_i\}$ basis, and such that $u_j = w_j$
    for $1 \leq j \leq r$.

    Examples
    ========

    Note: The function works in terms of columns, so in these examples we
    print matrix transposes in order to make the columns easier to inspect.

    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DM
    >>> from sympy import QQ, FF
    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import supplement_a_subspace
    >>> M = DM([[1, 7, 0], [2, 3, 4]], QQ).transpose()
    >>> print(supplement_a_subspace(M).to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 7, 0], [2, 3, 4], [1, 0, 0]])

    >>> M2 = M.convert_to(FF(7))
    >>> print(M2.to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, -3]])
    >>> print(supplement_a_subspace(M2).to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, -3], [0, 1, 0]])

    Parameters
    ==========

    M : :py:class:`~.DomainMatrix`
        The columns give the basis for the subspace.

    Returns
    =======

    :py:class:`~.DomainMatrix`
        This matrix is invertible and its first $r$ columns equal *M*.

    Raises
    ======

    DMRankError
        If *M* was not of maximal rank.
