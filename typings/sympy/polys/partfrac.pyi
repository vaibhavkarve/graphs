    Compute partial fraction decomposition of a rational function.

    Given a rational function ``f``, computes the partial fraction
    decomposition of ``f``. Two algorithms are available: One is based on the
    undetermined coefficients method, the other is Bronstein's full partial
    fraction decomposition algorithm.

    The undetermined coefficients method (selected by ``full=False``) uses
    polynomial factorization (and therefore accepts the same options as
    factor) for the denominator. Per default it works over the rational
    numbers, therefore decomposition of denominators with non-rational roots
    (e.g. irrational, complex roots) is not supported by default (see options
    of factor).

    Bronstein's algorithm can be selected by using ``full=True`` and allows a
    decomposition of denominators with non-rational roots. A human-readable
    result can be obtained via ``doit()`` (see examples below).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.partfrac import apart
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    By default, using the undetermined coefficients method:

    >>> apart(y/(x + 2)/(x + 1), x)
    -y/(x + 2) + y/(x + 1)

    The undetermined coefficients method does not provide a result when the
    denominators roots are not rational:

    >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x)
    y/(x**2 + x + 1)

    You can choose Bronstein's algorithm by setting ``full=True``:

    >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x, full=True)
    RootSum(_w**2 + _w + 1, Lambda(_a, (-2*_a*y/3 - y/3)/(-_a + x)))

    Calling ``doit()`` yields a human-readable result:

    >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x, full=True).doit()
    (-y/3 - 2*y*(-1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)/3)/(x + 1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2) + (-y/3 -
        2*y*(-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)/3)/(x + 1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)

    Compute partial fraction decomposition of a rational function
    and return the result in structured form.

    Given a rational function ``f`` compute the partial fraction decomposition
    of ``f``. Only Bronstein's full partial fraction decomposition algorithm
    is supported by this method. The return value is highly structured and
    perfectly suited for further algorithmic treatment rather than being
    human-readable. The function returns a tuple holding three elements:

    * The first item is the common coefficient, free of the variable `x` used
      for decomposition. (It is an element of the base field `K`.)

    * The second item is the polynomial part of the decomposition. This can be
      the zero polynomial. (It is an element of `K[x]`.)

    * The third part itself is a list of quadruples. Each quadruple
      has the following elements in this order:

      - The (not necessarily irreducible) polynomial `D` whose roots `w_i` appear
        in the linear denominator of a bunch of related fraction terms. (This item
        can also be a list of explicit roots. However, at the moment ``apart_list``
        never returns a result this way, but the related ``assemble_partfrac_list``
        function accepts this format as input.)

      - The numerator of the fraction, written as a function of the root `w`

      - The linear denominator of the fraction *excluding its power exponent*,
        written as a function of the root `w`.

      - The power to which the denominator has to be raised.

    On can always rebuild a plain expression by using the function ``assemble_partfrac_list``.

    Examples
    ========

    A first example:

    >>> from sympy.polys.partfrac import apart_list, assemble_partfrac_list
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, t

    >>> f = (2*x**3 - 2*x) / (x**2 - 2*x + 1)
    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)
    >>> pfd
    (1,
    Poly(2*x + 4, x, domain='ZZ'),
    [(Poly(_w - 1, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, 4), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1)])

    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)
    2*x + 4 + 4/(x - 1)

    Second example:

    >>> f = (-2*x - 2*x**2) / (3*x**2 - 6*x)
    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)
    >>> pfd
    (-1,
    Poly(2/3, x, domain='QQ'),
    [(Poly(_w - 2, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, 2), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1)])

    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)
    -2/3 - 2/(x - 2)

    Another example, showing symbolic parameters:

    >>> pfd = apart_list(t/(x**2 + x + t), x)
    >>> pfd
    (1,
    Poly(0, x, domain='ZZ[t]'),
    [(Poly(_w**2 + _w + t, _w, domain='ZZ[t]'),
    Lambda(_a, -2*_a*t/(4*t - 1) - t/(4*t - 1)),
    Lambda(_a, -_a + x),
    1)])

    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)
    RootSum(_w**2 + _w + t, Lambda(_a, (-2*_a*t/(4*t - 1) - t/(4*t - 1))/(-_a + x)))

    This example is taken from Bronstein's original paper:

    >>> f = 36 / (x**5 - 2*x**4 - 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + x - 2)
    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)
    >>> pfd
    (1,
    Poly(0, x, domain='ZZ'),
    [(Poly(_w - 2, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, 4), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1),
    (Poly(_w**2 - 1, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, -3*_a - 6), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 2),
    (Poly(_w + 1, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, -4), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1)])

    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)
    -4/(x + 1) - 3/(x + 1)**2 - 9/(x - 1)**2 + 4/(x - 2)
